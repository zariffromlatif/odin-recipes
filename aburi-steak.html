            “Aburi,” the technique applied to this aburi steak, means flame-seared in Japanese. The technique is often applied to raw fish, but it works well for tender, marbled beef cuts, too. A butane torch lets you customize the doneness. Torch less or more depending on how charred you like it.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 to 16 ounce) boneless rib eye steak</li>
            <li>1/2 cup short grain white rice</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup less-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Asian-style chili paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon lime zest</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons wasabi paste, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons furikake seasoning or toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put steak on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Freeze until just firm, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for sushi rice, rinse rice under cold running water, rubbing grains together with your fingers. Combine rice and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until tender and sticky, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir together vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Stir into rice. Cover; let cool about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, thinly slice steak across the grain into 24 (1/4-inch-thick) slices. Transfer steak to a zip-top bag set in a shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Whisk together soy sauce, maple syrup, chili paste, and oil in a small bowl. Pour over steak in bag; seal bag. Chill at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>For sauce, whisk together sour cream, lime zest, lime juice, and wasabi paste.</li>
            <li>Shape rice with wet hands into 24 (1-tablespoon) oval-shaped portions. Drain steak; discard marinade. Put steak on a foil-lined baking sheet set on a wire rack. Char steak with a kitchen torch, turning once, until desired doneness, about 5 minutes for entire recipe. Put 1 steak piece on each rice portion. Sprinkle with furikake seasoning and serve with sauce.</li>
        </ol>
