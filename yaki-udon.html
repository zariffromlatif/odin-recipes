            <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>1 medium garlic, grated</li>
            <li>1 medium (5-oz.) bunch scallions</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>12 ounces sliced mixed wild mushrooms (such as cremini, oyster, and shiitake) (about 6 cups)</li>
            <li>2 medium heads baby bok choy, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package carrots, cut into match-stick size pieces</li>
            <li>½ cup water, divided</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) package pre-cooked udon noodles (such as KA-ME)</li>
            <li>Optional garnishes: thinly sliced nori, cilantro, lime wedges, furikake seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together oyster sauce, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, Worcestershire, sesame oil, sugar, Sriracha, and garlic in a small bowl; set aside. Remove root ends from scallions and discard. Chop whites and light greens into 2-inch pieces and quarter pieces lengthwise; set aside. Thinly slice remaining dark greens of scallions and reserve for garnish.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on first side, about 3 minutes. Stir and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and golden brown on both sides, about 4 more minutes. Add bok choy, carrots, sliced whites and light greens of scallions, and 1/4 cup water to pan with mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add udon noodles and remaining 1/4 cup water and cook, gently separating noodles with tongs or spoon. Add reserved oyster sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until noodles and vegetables are well-coated, about 1 minute. Divide among serving bowls and garnish with reserved sliced greens of scallions and optional garnishes. Serve immediately.</li>
